# simplyLamport
A simple implementation of the Lamport-Diffie signature.

## TO-DO
Optimizations in the code and in the cryptographic "protocol" (Merkle trees or whatever), as well as improvements to it (such as adding the existence of user IDs and key IDs, the possibility of adding more information to the keys, etc, turning this into something like PGP).
